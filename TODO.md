# TODO
- Move non-sensitive environment variables out of user-secrets (dev) / env variables (prod) and into appsettings(.Development).json
  - Can you mix and match these?
- Build an in-memory database in the repo so I can start testing the controller / service logic
- Build session token authorization
- Figure out email verification
- Tie everything into the front-end
