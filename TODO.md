# TODO
- Tie everything into the front-end
- Logging
- Ensure everything still works in production
  - Especially the email verification html template, the Path will probably be an issue
- Create a new class for incoming new user requests that does not include Role
  - CreateNewUser role should always be UNVALIDATED_USER, this request needs no validation
  - CreateNewAdmin role should always be ADMIN, this request is only callable by a super admin
- Build middleware that converts UserModels in response to UserViewModel, just to make sure raw UserModel never escapes
- Figure out what to do with old accounts that are never verified. Probably purge them after 24 hours?
- Add a Super User account created when the server is launched
  - Get default credentials from env variable
  - Super Admin should change their password asap for security
  - Check if there is already a super admin in DB on launch, if there isn't, create it; if there is, do nothing
